# TheVault

<h2> Description </h2>
Stylish front-end paired with a fully functioning backend server app for login/sign up functionality.
Allows users to sign up with a username and password which is then hashed, salted, and stored in a database (using MongoDB and Studio3T).


Users are then authenticated and have a cookie session opened. This allows the user to skip the login process (by adding "/secrets" at the end of the URL) until the cookie is destroyed
by ending the browser session (closing window), or clicking the logout button.
